## Key Findings

### December 2025: Deadliest Month
- **7 deaths total** in ICE custody (Austin Kocher verified)
- **5 of those deaths** are now in our verified database
- **Context:** Record detention population of 68,442 coincided with deaths
- **Congressional Response:** Multiple Congress members demanded investigations
- **Medical Care Concerns:** Reports of inadequate care at multiple facilities

### Source Quality Issues Identified
1. **ICE.gov website redirecting:** Official death reporting page not accessible (redirects to DHS NTAS)
2. **Delayed reporting:** ICE required to report deaths within 30 days, but website hasn't been updated since October 2025
3. **Transparency gaps:** Makes independent verification difficult

### Austin Kocher's Tracking Work
- **Most reliable source** for ICE detention deaths
- Provides names, dates, facilities, causes
- Includes context about facility conditions
- Cites original reporting (NOTUS, El Paso Times, Reuters)
- Cross-references Congressional statements

---

## Recommendations for Project

### 1. Source Architecture Changes
**REQUIRED:** Add `quote` field to sources table
```sql
ALTER TABLE sources ADD COLUMN quote TEXT;
ALTER TABLE sources ADD COLUMN quote_context TEXT;
```

### 2. Verification Status Field
**RECOMMENDED:** Track verification level for each case
```sql
ALTER TABLE cases ADD COLUMN verification_status VARCHAR(50) 
DEFAULT 'verified' CHECK (verification_status IN ('verified', 'preliminary', 'needs_review'));
```

### 3. Ongoing Monitoring
- Subscribe to Austin Kocher's Substack for death notifications
- Set up alerts for ICE death reports from Reuters, NOTUS, AP
- Monitor Congressional statements (especially immigration committee members)
- Track detention facility inspection reports

### 4. Quote Attribution Standards
For each source, include:
- Exact quote (in quotation marks)
- Speaker name and title
- Context of statement
- Date of statement
- Original source URL

### 5. Family/Advocate Quotes
**Priority:** Seek quotes from:
- Family members (like Lucía Pedro Juan for Francisco Gaspar-Andres)
- Attorneys representing detainees
- Congressional representatives who visited facilities
- Medical staff/whistleblowers
